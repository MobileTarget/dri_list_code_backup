1 move “next” button on phone page slightly up—right now ios keyboard covers it

2 a) I sent text “hi1” sent me response text twice *stop the special text to me*,  
  b) did NOT send me push - app was open will require that change we talked about sending push when app is open

3 even though I was in category page, the system auto refreshed and took me to my chats page — system should never change pages on me
 — based on what we have discussed it should NOT have auto refreshed either.

4 I was on my chats, I texted from phone weather…page refreshed very quickly — then “loading” icon appeared, took a while, screen flashed, back to same screen that had originally refreshed fine

5 on my chats I typed reservations:
  screen auto refreshed very quickly-good
  then even though screen was fine it did  “loading” …slow…screen back to my chats again with no change
  then it flashed again and I was in stumped messages

3 I sent “tuesday” even though I was in category page, the system auto refreshed and took me to my chats page (same issue of 3 above)  — system should never change pages on me — based on what we have discussed it should NOT have auto refreshed either.

6 I minimized app, sent 4pm .. did get push notification … clicked on push notification … sent me to my chats— should have sent me to stumped

7 I texted 5, I got *two push notifications* let me check avail & 5 — I opened app….I was in my chats…the conversation did NOT update

8 make “roger is typing” stay on the screen longer…ie 10 seconds after last keystroke—right now it disappears right away
