We need less space between messages if possible.

I still personally get text messages from system instead or in addition to push notifications - would like to stop this.

The system knows my first name— why does the phone list 12145644732 … it should show “Roger” there…i.e. on firstname update that records should be updated

Time between enter phone and code is VERY long

User (231) 642-1353 sent text into system
I did NOT get any push notifications even if app open or even if closed 
I entered “hi” back to him from stumped.  “Hi” did NOT add itself to screen

On a browser I went to stumped 12145644732, said “hi111”
the app was on phone list - this did trigger push notification to on app (the app was open — this is good)
however hi111 did NOT get added to bottom of screen

On a browser I went to stumped 12145644732, said “hiagain”
the app was on stumped 12145644732 —as I typed “roger is typing” did appear
I click sent from browser—hhagain did NOT get added to bottom of screen
This did trigger push notification to on app - It should NOT have since I was on that same page that was being refreshed
It should have triggered a page refresh — it did NOT

I texted “test1234”
I did get push notification — I clicked on it…it did NOT take me to the right page
The browser version of app DID auto refresh (it was on the messages page)
The app version was on phone list …when I clicked on 12145644732 it did NOT update
