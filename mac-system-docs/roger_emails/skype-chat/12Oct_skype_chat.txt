1 move “next” button on phone page slightly up—right now ios keyboard covers it

2 I sent text “hi1” sent me response text twice,  did not send me push

3 even though I was in category page, the system auto refreshed and took me to my chats page

4 I was on my chats, I texted from phone weather…page refreshed very quickly — then “loading” icon appeared, took a while, screen flashed, back to same screen that had originally refreshed fine

5 on my chats I typed reservations:
  screen auto refreshed very quickly-good
  then even though screen was fine it did  “loading” …slow…screen back to my chats again with no change
  then it flashed again and I was in stumped messages

3 I sent “tuesday” even though I was in category page, the system auto refreshed and took me to my chats page (same issue of 3 above)





I texted in

7 I texted 5, I got two push notifications let me check avail & 5 — I opened app….I was in my chats…the conversation did NOT update

I had to do a pull down for an update

"3 I sent “tuesday” even though I was in category page, the system auto refreshed and took me to my chats page (same issue of 3 above)"

point is that the app should never change pages on me

also based on what we have discussed it should NOT have auto refreshed either.

i.e. should only refresh auto if the page I am in changed
