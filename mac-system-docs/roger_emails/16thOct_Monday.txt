Previous issues
1) it still takes a long time between phone and code entry

2) The system knows my first name— why does the phone list 12145644732 … it should show “Roger” there…i.e. on firstname update that records should be updated 
When user records are updated we should update related tasks

Bugs (* = bug)
I texted “reservations”
app got two push notifications—*why two?
browser was on my chats - messages — browser did refresh
app was on “reminderbot” screen—I clicked reminderbot this took me to messages…*content of that screen had NOT refreshed 
I pulled down on ios to see past push notifications, however, they were not there—*they did not persist, they should persist

with app minimized — texted “monday 3 people” — opened app “my chats” — *conversation had not refreshed 

in browser, stumped, 12145644732 I entered “hi in future”, clicked on time button and edited send time by a minute
*it did not appear in stumped 12145644732
*it did not send me text, but did add to “my chats"
*it did not change color of this future message or turn it into a regular message
*schedule screen did not have my time zone - or unclear how to enter — needs pull down
*when color changes it should trigger changes to ws for refresh (i.e. any change in detail)
*I forced a refresh — on screen ”hi 2nd responder” became “hi 1st responder”

It seems issue might be related to multiple devices — keeping track of what device is in what page and if refreshed on one device maybe keeping track that other devices have not been refreshed

In stumped I entered “hi from operator” did refresh it in my chats, *but not “Monday 3pm” still missing from conversation 

*I texted “hi”, got push notification, I clicked on push notification it did NOT open to the right page

less space between messages - so more messages fit on screen --done

Content of Push notifications should include group, from what user, what did the user say
“group 1 - 12145644732 - reservations”
try doing this using a template

add me to second responders group also

Discuss with me BEFORE working on this
I tried to add myself to second group-the assistants / those screens are not to spec

Assistants is a screen where the user TYPES phone numbers to add users to that screen
Manage first responders is a screen where the added users are shown…and user checks them on / off

Watson-add / user first_name
I added the following json to “let me check availability”
{
  "context": {
    "save": {
      "user_master_general": [
        "first_name"
      ],
      "first_name": "@sys-name"
    }
  },
  "output": {
    "text": {
      "values": [
        "Let me check availability"
      ],
      "selection_policy": "sequential"
    }
  }
}

This is what should happen:
Watson should ask for first_name only the first time (because will be in context later)
Outgoing context should have
	first_name AND
	save: {user_master_general: [“first_name”]}
When receiving FROM Watson
	your code should look for save.user_master_general
	go through that array of fields to look in context that need to be saved
	save to <user>.data.master.general.first_name: Roger
	we will save more stuff in the future
Before sending TO Watson 
	look at user.data.master.general
	add all of those key values into context
	i.e. add first_name: Roger to context variable going to Watson
	we will add more stuff that was saved in future
First_name is a special case … maybe we add code to update <user>.first_name also
